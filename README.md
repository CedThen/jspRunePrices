# Jsp Rune Prices

In a game without convenient ways to value and trade items, people turn to 3rd party methods to trade their hard earned goods. d2Jsp.com was created to help facilitate trades using their own currency, which helped people price their goods in relation to a standard currency, instead of relying on intuition as to an item's worth in comparison to other items.

However, d2jsp has its weaknesses. It is simply a forum for people to make posts, and there aren't many tools to help users make decisions beyond a simple search of the item's latest going prices. Hence, this project was born as a way to accumulate data on the most commonly traded items - runes. I hope this app makes it easier to visualize rune prices, and makes it easier to make trades on d2Jsp.com
